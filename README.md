## Install
`     $ npm i --save random-joke-getter`



## Usage

```javascript
var joker = require('random-joke-getter');
 
// Get a random dad joke
joker.getDadJoke (function(joke) {
    //=> console.log(joke);
});
 
// Get a random programming joke
joker.getProgrammingJoke (function(joke) {
    //=> console.log(joke);

// Get a random joke
joker.getRandomJoke (function(joke) {

## Examples and Formatting

Dad jokes are formatted on a single line
Example: Where do rabbits go after they get married? On a bunny-moon.

Programming and random jokes are formatted with a newline in between the setup and punchline.

Programming example: 

```
How do you check if a webpage is HTML5?

Try it out on Internet Explorer
```
